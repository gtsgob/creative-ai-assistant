# Creative AI Assistant

This repository hosts the Creative AI Assistant, an experimental cognitive partner designed to co‑evolve with the user.  The assistant aims to amplify creativity and reasoning by combining state‑of‑the‑art AI techniques (meta‑learning, retrieval‑augmented generation, knowledge‑graph reasoning) with quantum‑inspired processing from the Agothe ecosystem.

## Project overview

The core ideas behind this project are described in the `creative-ai-assistant-upload.zip` skeleton.  In essence, the assistant maintains a problem graph of your projects, explores divergent and convergent ideas, reflects on its own performance, and incorporates personalised taste and ethical considerations.

This repository will serve as the integration hub for several modules:

- **quantum_simulation** – wraps the [Agothe Quantum App](https://github.com/gtsgob/agothe-quantum-app) as a service.  It exposes the collapse engine and provides quantum seeds (α/β eigenvalues and resonance patterns) that can be used to influence creative generation.
- **qread_integration** – integrates the [Agothe Q‑Read Pipeline](https://github.com/gtsgob/agothe-qread-pipeline) for quantum‑inspired knowledge‑graph processing.  It uses layered PL/IL/NL encodings, entanglement and Grover‑style amplification【795836877252778†L13-L29】, and computes scores like Resonance Score and Emergence Stability Index【795836877252778†L20-L31】.
- **meta_learning**, **retrieval**, **kg_integration**, etc. – placeholder modules for future contributions (see roadmap).

## Getting started

1. **Unpack the skeleton** – Download and unzip `creative-ai-assistant-upload.zip` to view the original project layout.
2. **Explore the quantum modules** – Check out the Agothe quantum repositories to understand the API contracts【730441553254537†L9-L16】 and feature set.
3. **Develop new modules** – Implement code under `modules/` to bridge the quantum functionality with the AI assistant; see the module READMEs for guidance.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Integrate the skeleton structure into the repository (extracted from the zip).
- [ ] Add meta‑learning loops and retrieval‑augmented generation.
- [ ] Wrap the quantum collapse engine as a micro‑service in `modules/quantum_simulation`.
- [ ] Incorporate the Q‑Read entanglement, scoring and summarization routines in `modules/qread_integration`.
- [ ] Combine the problem graph with quantum‑inspired knowledge graphs and ledger tracking.

This project is experimental and under heavy development.  Contributions and discussion are welcome!
